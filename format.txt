                    ----    POLYGON TEXT FORMAT     ----                       

# Description:

    Textual description of a polygon arangement in two dimensions.
    
    A POLYGON arrangement consists of a single POINT, a line defined by a list
    of subsequent points (POLYLINE) or a closed POLYGON bounding a FACE in the
    arrangement.
    
    FACES are completely bounded by an bounding POLYGON. The only exception is
    the INFINITE FACE which is all the free space not covered by any other
    FACE.

    A POLYGON may have inner HOLEs - i.e. a face bounded by another POLYGON
    which is completely contained in the bounded face.
    Further a HOLE may consist of several POLYGONs which together completely
    fill the shape of the HOLE.
    A HOLE may also consist of only a POINT or POLYLINE.


# The text file format:

    For a FACE the text format defines an id and the boundary as a sequence of
    x, y coordinates of the defining points when traversing the boundary
    polygon in counterclockwise order.
    Then it specifies the number of holes. For each hole its boundary is given
    as a clockwise traversation of the defining points x, y coordinates.
    The faces defining the HOLE are given by their ID. In case of the hole
    being just a POLYLINE or a POINT this is empty.


    ## The FACE record

    A FACE record is defined as follows (each value is separated by a blank):
        - 1st line:
            ID      -   The ID of the FACE
            Bound   -   The boundary of the face in 'x y x y x y ...' of a
                        counterclockwise traversal of the boundary POLYGON.
        - 2nd line:
            #HOLES  -   The number of holes of the FACE
    
    The following 2*#HOLEs many lines are describing the HOLEs. Each HOLE is
    defined in two lines as follows:
        - 1st line:
            Bound   -   lockwise traversal of the bounding POLYGON of the hole
                        given by 'x y x y x y x y ...'
        - 2nd line:
            IDs     -   IDs of the FACEs contained in the HOLE.
                        The line may be empty if the HOLE is a POLYLINE or
                        a single POINT


    ## Special case: The INFINITE FACE

    Each file is starting with the INFINITE FACE. In this case the first line
    of the FACE record is skipped. So the INFINITE FACE has no specified ID
    and no bounding POLYGON.

    ## Example:

    Let an example arrangement given by the edges as follows:

      # x y x y         of the edge source and target vertex

        0 0 0 6         x --------------------- x
        0 6 6 6         |                       |
        6 6 6 0         |   x ------------- x   |
        6 0 0 0         |   |             / |   |
                        |   |   x       /   |   |
        1 1 5 1         |   |         /     |   |
        5 1 5 5         |   |       /   x   |   |
        5 5 1 1         |   |     /   /     |   |
        1 1 1 5         |   |   /   x       |   |
        1 5 5 5         |   | /             |   |    
                        |   x ------------- x   |
        3 2 4 3         |                       |
        2 4 2 4         x --------------------- x
               
        A corresponding representation is as follows:
